# Pokedex project

## The pokedex website

The pokedex utilises the pokeapi.co resource and displays all of the 151 base pokemon from the first instalments of the franchise.

The pokemon can be viewed as a big list and individually where you can go one by one. Alternatively if you have a pokemon in mind that you wish to view you can search for it using the search bar.

## Navigating the website

The website is responsive depending on your screen size, so you can view your favourite pokemon even on the go!

The homepage will display a list of all pokemon.

You can select an indivdual pokemon from here which will go to that individual pokemon page and display their stats. This is displayed in a similar layout to a pokemon card.

Clicking the 'Individuals' nav link will load a random pokemon for you!

Or you can search for a specific pokemon if you have one in mind.

While viewing an individual pokemon you can go back and forth in the pokedex one by one.
